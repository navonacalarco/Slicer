#Description:  
               #This script checks the automated QC results produced by dwiprep. Even though 
               #I am using preprocessed outputs from dmriprep (in-house pipeline), the 
               #automated dwiprep QC outputs remain useful. Specifically, we check for the 
               #3 PASS results at the end of each participant's `*_QCReport.txt` file. All 
               #participants that PASS are included in subsequent analyses

#Submission:   #Run as bash or interactively in terminal

#Notes:        #If it exists, make sure to remove the `participants.csv` file that has been 
               #added in the archive, from 02_dwiprepQC_automatedFAILS.txt and 03_sublist.txt
