These scripts should be run sequentially. A banner at the top of each script contains relevant notes about the script, and how to run it.

Note: The `/outdated` subfolder contains 3 scripts previously in use for single-tensor tractography. Now that we are using two-tensor UKF tractography, they are moot here, but may be relevant for others' future analyses.
